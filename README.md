**Inflow Computation in Reservoirs**

Efficient water management strategies and resource planning are required to maximize the value of water resources; knowledge of historical inflow data is very relevant.There are no direct methods to measure water inflows as it typically comprises of stream runoffs and surrounding tributaries. 

Reservoir inflow is estimated using water balance method involving reservoir release and change in storage during the period considered. Water discharge data of the mainstream is readily available available, however observations from the tributaries are not easily quantifiable. The water balance equation is

Here, HW is the observed water level. It should be noted that the water losses are not usually quantified so for this calculation, it is assumed to be negligible.


The data for computing the relationship between the reservoir storage and elevation were provided by the TVA through direct correspondence, which is plotted to obtain the function as shown in Fig 10. A second-degree polynomial relationship is identified between the elevation level and reservoir volume, expressed as:
