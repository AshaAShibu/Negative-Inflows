**Inflow Computation in Reservoirs**

Efficient water management strategies and resource planning are required to maximize the value of water resources; knowledge of historical inflow data is very relevant.There are no direct methods to measure water inflows as it typically comprises of stream runoffs and surrounding tributaries. 

Reservoir inflow is estimated using water balance method involving reservoir release and change in storage during the period considered. Water discharge data of the mainstream is readily available available, however observations from the tributaries are not easily quantifiable. The water balance equation is

The reservoir storage is estimated by the reservoir stage-elevation relationship
